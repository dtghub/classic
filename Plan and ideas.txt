Start working on outline of project;

Need to create a basic outline and then flesh it out in stages.

Ideas for side projects can be listed as we go along, done as a separate repository, and pulled in as we go.

Initial idea is to implement a basic version fully in-browser, implementing the saves via cookies. Then re-implement as a Node project.

================================
Main adventure game Ideas
--------------
Code;
Just do it all in one textbox in the web page to begin with.
Need to have a 'map' of 'rooms' and the links between the rooms.
Do we store the objects in the rooms or the rooms in the objects?

Command parsing; keywords for now - look at nlp stuff in the future?

Save games using cookies to start with - maybe have save slots that the user can select?
Do we have some sort of game progress score - as an absolute figure and a percentage of the game perhaps?

Plot/story Ideas
Main goal to be reach a certain 'room' to obtain an object?
Different types of objects
Have a max number of 'standard' objects that can be carried at once

Maybe some special objects of various kinds e.g. an invisibility cloak which when worn don't occupy your inventory, but maybe some can only be used for a certain number of turns.

Ideas for the side projects;
 - Conways game of life in JS - goal for user is to create a pattern which survives for at least a certain number of generations to pass into the new area.

- Block slider puzzle in JS - solve the puzzle to pass or open the safe to get the object, like a key etc...

- Bug reporting tool - with an option to choose the image of your insect and what it had done to deserve reporting in the fictional local town's newspaper. A variation on this must have been done a million times before, so it needs some twists - maybe an report is generated as a newspaper article based on what options the user selects during the reporting process.
