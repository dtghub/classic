Start working on outline of project;

Need to create a basic outline and then flesh it out in stages.

Ideas for side projects can be listed as we go along, done as a separate repository, and pulled in as we go.

Initial idea is to implement a basic version fully in-browser, implementing the saves via cookies. Then re-implement as a Node project.

================================
Main adventure game Ideas
--------------
Code;
Just do it all in one textbox in the web page to begin with.
Need to have a 'map' of 'rooms' and the links between the rooms.
Do we store the objects in the rooms or the rooms in the objects?

Command parsing; keywords for now - look at nlp stuff in the future?

Save games using cookies to start with - maybe have save slots that the user can select?

---------------
Plot/story Ideas
Main goal to be reach a certain 'room' to obtain an object
Different types of objects
Have a max number of 'standard' objects that can be carried at once 

Maybe some special objects like an invisibility cloak

================================


================================
Ideas for the side projects;
 - Conways game of life in JS - goal for user is to create a pattern which survives for at least a certain number of generations to pass into the new area.

- Block slider puzzle in JS - solve the puzzle to pass or open the safe to get the object, like a key etc...
