Start working on outline of project;

Need to create a basic outline and then flesh it out in stages.

Ideas for side projects can be listed as we go along, done as a separate repository, and pulled in as we go.

Initial idea is to implement a basic version fully in-browser, implementing the saves via cookies. Then re-implement as a Node project.
